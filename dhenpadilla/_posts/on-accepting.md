I signed up for therapy.
Things feel like they should start making sense.

I shower every-day. I shower every morning.
Part of my day that feels so safe.
Like it's always there for me, no matter the time. Probably why I don't mind the rain.

The smell of rain reminds me of our rooftop. The fights we have. The night we danced.

I'm tired of feeling like I have to be more than all that. Imagine what it feels like to be accepted. 
Ah, to be accepted by your self!

I bought a churro from 7-eleven this evening.
Along with 2 cans of Suntory Premium.

I took one bite and left it on the side.

I want a hug.


I've been smoking recently. Malboro Ice Blast 8s. 
It's like itching a mosquito bite. Like inhaling melancholy that others can also see. Like an introvert's way of screaming.

I've been particularly intrigued by this artist called Ellen Nielsen^1^.
There's a space that does not need filling and she lets it breathe.

I haven't read something new in a while. 
Sometimes I fail to read my own mind.
