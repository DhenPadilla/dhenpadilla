Running once again. Not away, but towards. I've ended up by the sea. In attempts to find a dead end, and nowhere else to look but inside. A dear old man sits next to me. Silent. Our trousers don't match. Highlighted where the baggy folds of our garments meet. Blue on Green. 
Enough space for 8, but we sit together. 
Representing the unspoken formality of the world, he places his hands on his knees as he waits for the train. There's a playful tension between us whilst we feel the waves crawl up the pier and crash against the concrete waiting for the next train. 
This station is by the sea. A small station, 2-carriages long. A single track runs close to the edge of the earth and the train is never late. Paper tickets of course.

I see this silence in between the sea and our bench as both safety and no-mans land. If either of us walk into it, various lives unfold. 

This thought wanders into my past: Tirelessly building product on product, out of sheer will. Dreaming of more, whatever that means. Hosting sponsored events in New York city. The feeling at the U.S. border each time I land at JFK. The search for optimal. Performance and resilience. The loins. Anecdotes advertising multiple angles of life and _how to be_, that evolve into whole dimensions of pressure. Trying to find peace in the pauses.
I wonder if this finely aged japanese man, with glasses glistening like the sea in front of him, feels this pressure too.
He's probably just waiting for the train.

This tango with my reality as the hyper productive founding engineer, fighting for more of everything. More revenue, more knowledge, more growth. 

The _dewdrop_^1^ falls. Life through the lens of that dewdrop has become clearer. Driving me back to the soil and the sea. The quiet lullabies of the world have crystallized themselves as true facets of my being, and it doesn't feel like a _'North Star'_. It is mere energy. 
The dissonance of mechanical precision towards greatness and these perfectly messy tinctures of life have found an overtone that I wish to play for all hearts because it feels so earthly. Timely, really. Like there's a space in the soul of this lifetime that yearns for liberty. 

In the same way, I yearn now for tools that free us, rather than aim us. Tools that breathe into our soul. Where the aim isn't to be more productive, but to just be.

As my dewdrop lens shows me, life mutates in arbitrary and harmonic ways and we love the control of its narrative. So wildly focused on scale, dominion, insurgence, achievement. But it's the fact we get to be witness to this irrepressable metamorphosis that fires colors into our lives.
Hearing "How I got to $X million ARR in Y days" feels like a far cry to peace. While watching a man's leathered fingers rise and fall - as he taps his heel against the concrete - plays an isochronic tone^2^ in my life. 


I reflect on the past 3 years. On moments that felt catalytic to my life. Purest connection and re-connection with the world. 
Challenge, laughter, confusion, alignment. All grounded in: "I see you for who you are right now, and _I am with you_".

I recall the numina from our first ever payment from a customer at Streamline. We were so young then.
It wasn't from seeing the first $100 land in our Stripe account that cemented a new memory in my lifetime.
We drove 2 hours to Stinson Beach in celebration, but stopped and b-lined towards a river, to breathe the spring air of our new accomplishment together. Doug and I throwing ourselves into the stream whilst Helena rests on the overpass, marinating her gorgeous energy in California solstice. I realized then that the moments I aim for were those that reunite me with time again.

I want to journey with people again. Not in being. But in becoming. The purpose is to craft experiences that whisper to your soul than shout at an ego. To help you slow it all down. Not in aim of anything 'more', but to level you again with what is already yours; this dewdrop world. That reconciles you to the person that waits for the same train next to you, through the no-man's land of the world, because you'll both have to leave the station soon enough.
