The screech of the sax harmized with the kettle. The glasses are tinkling slightly as accompaniment. I am struggling to think. Or rather, I'm struggling to hold on to one main thought. Finding comfort in the sound. How loud they're playing in this cafe!

'Big Boy' indeed. The name of this jazz cafe on an alleyway in Jimbocho City. The name invites itself, really. 3 50x50 vm mahogany tables by the entrance. I think it's about 11m^2 in floor space, and only 60% of that is for customers.
The windows are lined with wiring, latticed with a diamond pattern. 2 large window panes for each wall that faces the street (the bar sits in the corner slot of the alley's crossroades). The door, a sombre yellow japanese wood that opens outward, is sandwiched between these panes. Each large enough to project the outside like a theatre screen. Small enough to be inviting in those walking past.

I'm sat front row to this screen. There's only really one row of tables, so I suppose I'm also sat on the back row too. The man to my left, late 60s I presume. Stylishly bald. Also facing the screen, but not watching. His eyes are closed. Aiming his attention deep into the track that is playing. Or thinking about his last affair. Deep indigo jeans paired with a comme des garcons / nike air max that make me feel confused in a wonderful way. On the torso, white shirt. Pinstriped with black lines, like his moustache.

Another japanese man to my right. Hair on this one. His back is against the window. The overhead light is warming his worn skin. I see him clearly. Arms folded. His spoon is turned upside, to show its job is done. I can't see the tip of it, but I imagine the tea has dried on its end. These details all feel so unimportant, which makes it important to me.
Old enough to be the left man's younger brother by 3 years difference. No moustache though. 
I hear him sniffling, but no tears seem to be forming each time I glance over. It feels like he is crying for me.
Defending against his emotions, he reaches for his teacup and just before the dam of his feelings overflow, the track switches. He's safe.

I see myself in his eyes. Maybe because he's sniffling for me. 'Big boy' indeed.

A fine young woman enters now - beige trenchcoat, black beanie to match her shades. Chiselled face. All the big boys straighten up.

The owner: Yatashi. Another big boy. Clearly proud of his creation. His team, his wife. He moves with an energy that I can only describe as 'paced whimsical'. His haircut matches his wife's, medium, rounded, grey. I wonder who he loves more between her and his records. They've covered these walls.

Condensation on the glass falls through my veins all the way into my toes. There's peace here. Like I've been here before (I haven't). I have been here for a few hours now, and the world continues as I sit here. I suppose this is what rest feels like.
