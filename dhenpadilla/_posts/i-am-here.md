This is what being here looks like.

I am here. That is all I am.

Here doesn't lie. Here is true.
It gives and receives as much as is required from it.

I sit with the cracks of the mahogany panels beside me. The slow decay is almost audible. Between imagination and reality. Sinking quietly into the seams. _I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?_^1^

I suppose that's where we all live. Some time within-between dreams and presence. Stirring between the two realms.
