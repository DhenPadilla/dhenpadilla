I signed up for therapy.
So it should start making sense, right?

I shower every day. I shower every morning.
The part of my day that feels so safe.
It doesn't rush. Accompanied only for as long as company must be held. 
It invites me without pressure. And is sad when I go.

Probably why I love the rain.

The smell of rain reminds me of our rooftop. The fights we have. The night we danced.

Ah, to be accepted by your self!

I bought a churro from 7-eleven this evening.
Along with 2 cans of Suntory Premium.

I took one bite and left it on the side.
I finished the second can, and wrote this.




I want a hug.





I've been smoking again. My dear Malboro ice blast 8s. 
Like exhaling melancholy for you to see. I can't explain it, but it's kinda like humming.
I should do without this silly addiction. I hope it be short-lived and more temporary than I am.

I pray to be ankle deep in the earth again. To root into ground I assimilate with again. I hope for it to be ubiquitious. To blossom through me. Prune my thorns. 
I pray I see it again soon.

_New_ lasts 6 seconds. The days feel ripe, but little feels fresh.

I haven't read something crucial in a while. 
Sometimes I fail to read my own mind.
